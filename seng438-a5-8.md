| Data                                 |     $\frac{41}{351} = 0.117$ |     $\frac{351}{41} = 8.561$ |
| Discrete Weibull Type III (All data) |     $\frac{41}{351} = 0.117$ |     $\frac{351}{41} = 8.561$ |
| Truncated Logistic (All Data)        |     $\frac{41}{351} = 0.117$ |     $\frac{351}{41} = 8.561$ |
| Discrete Weibull Type III (Subset)   | $\frac{41}{362.536} = 0.113$ | $\frac{362.536}{41} = 8.842$ |
| Truncated Logistic (Subset)          | $\frac{41}{356.605} = 0.115$ | $\frac{356.605}{41} = 8.698$ |

- Subset: the model uses the first 31 data points and then predicts the last 10.

Having the failure datasets in the incorrect format made it difficult to get started with C-SFRAT and STRAT. Also the lack of documentation on how to use STRAT made it difficult to use for the Reliability Demonstration Chart (RDC) in part 2.
